# SOP2TOP

a very straight forward implementation of SOP2TOP which avoids the user having to first convert to CHOP and therefore gives a significant performance increase.

Developed because it was needed for a specific project, and not with the intention of making it shared. But decided to make it public in case it could be usefull for someone. Use at own risk.

## building

compile for windows using the build.bat script or through visual studio

## usage (windows)

- add CPlusPlus TOP and select sop2top.dll
- drag SOP to the sop input field under "custom" 

## missing
- OSX build
